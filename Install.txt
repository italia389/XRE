Instructions for Installing the XRE Library

Installer packages for the XRE library are included for the macOS platform and
Linux platforms (CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).  The
standard installation packages place files in /usr/local and require superuser
(root) privileges.  (C include files, man pages, and the 'libxre.a' static
library are installed.)  If you are not installing on a macOS or GNU/Linux
platform, want to install in your HOME directory, or want to customize the
installation process, please refer to file CustomInstall.txt for instructions.

For a standard installation of the XRE library, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this Install.txt file:

	$ cd XRE-master

 2. If you are installing on a Linux platform, go to the next step; otherwise,
    go to step 5.

 3. The Linux library installer is xre-1.2.0.sh, which includes 64-bit binaries
    built on a CentOS vers. 6 machine.  To run the installer, type the following
    commands:

	$ su root
	# ./xre-1.2.0.sh
	# exit

 4. Go to step 6.

 5. The macOS installer is xre-1.2.0.pkg, which includes 64-bit binaries
    built for macOS vers. 10.12 (Sierra) and later.  Open the installer package
    with the following command:

	$ open xre-1.2.0.pkg

    and run the installer.

 6. The installers place two versions of the XRE library in /usr/local/lib and
    create a symbolic link to the one that supports wide characters and
    multibyte characters.  The other library supports 8-bit characters only (the
    C language default) and thus, provides some improved performance.  If you
    want the 8-bit library to be the default, type the following commands:

	$ su root
	# ln -sfh /usr/local/lib/libxre{-8bit,}.a
	# exit

 7. If you want to install the source files for the included regular expression
    test utility (txre.c) into your HOME directory, go to the last step of the
    installation instructions in file CustomInstall.txt.  If you are installing
    on a macOS system however, Xcode must already be installed (vers. 7.2.1 or
    later recommended) so that command-line tools are available.

Note that in order to link your programs with the XRE library, you must use the
-lxre switch or provide the library path (/usr/local/lib/libxre.a) to the
linker.  Also, see xregex(3) for a description of the XRE core library routines
and xre_format(7) for a description of the regular expression syntax.
