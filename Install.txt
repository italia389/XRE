Instructions for Installing the XRE Library

Installer packages are included for the macOS platform and Linux platforms
(CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).  The standard
installation packages place files in /usr/local and require superuser (root)
privileges.  (C include files, man pages, and the 'libxre.a' static library are
installed.)  If you are not installing on a macOS or GNU/Linux platform, want to
install the XRE library in your HOME directory, or want to customize the
installation process, please refer to file CustomInstall.txt for instructions.

For a standard installation of the XRE library, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this Install.txt file:

	$ cd XRE-master

 2. If you are installing on a Linux platform, go to the next step; otherwise,
    go to step 5.

 3. The Linux installer is xre-1.0.0.sh, which includes 64-bit binaries built
    on a CentOS vers. 6 machine.  To run the installer, type the following
    commands:

	$ su root
	# ./xre-1.0.0.sh
	# exit

 4. Go to step 6.

 5. The macOS installer is xre-1.0.0.pkg, which includes 64-bit binaries
    built for macOS vers. 10.10 (Yosemite) and later.  Open the installer
    package with the following command:

	$ open xre-1.0.0.pkg

    and run the installer.

 6. The installers place two versions of the XRE library in /usr/local/lib and
    create a symbolic link to the one that supports wide characters and
    multibyte characters.  The other library supports 8-bit characters only (the
    C language default) and thus, provides some improved performance.  If you
    want the 8-bit library to be the default, type the following commands:

	$ su root
	# ln -sfh /usr/local/lib/libxre{-8bit,}.a
	# exit

Note that the -lxre switch or path to the XRE library (/usr/local/lib/libxre.a)
must be provided to the linker when you link your programs.  See xre_core(3) for
a description of the XRE core library routines, and xre_format(7) for a
description of the regular expression syntax.
