Advanced Installation Instructions for the XRE Library

This distribution includes standard installer packages for the macOS platform
and Linux platforms (CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).
If you are installing on one of these platforms, have superuser (root)
privileges, do not want to install the XRE library in your HOME directory, and
do not want to customize the installation process, please refer to file
Install.txt for instructions on using the standard installers.

64-bit binaries and make files for macOS and Linux platforms are included in
this distribution.  If you are not installing on a macOS or GNU/Linux platform,
the installation scripts will automatically select and use the Linux make file
for compilation.  However, compilation on other platforms has not been tested,
so it is possible that there may be errors.  If this occurs, please contact the
author with the details so that the problem can be resolved.  (See the ReadMe.md
file for contact information.)  For reference, the make file location is:

	linux/Makefile

To install the XRE library with optional customizations, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this CustomInstall.txt file:

	$ cd XRE-master

 2. Type the following command to remove library binaries.  Note that if you are
    installing on a macOS system, Xcode must already be installed (vers. 7.2.1
    or later recommended) so that command-line tools are available:

	$ make clean

 3. Review and/or edit the #define statements in the configuration section at
    the beginning of header include/xre.h to customize the XRE library
    compilation.  Be sure to set the HaveHdr_* lines correctly.

 4. Build the XRE library.  This will create file "libxre.a" in the current
    directory.  Note that during compilation you may see warnings about
    uninitialized variables, signed/unsigned comparisons, or other messages with
    some compilers.  These may be ignored:

	$ make

 5. Install the XRE library.  If you have superuser privileges and want to do a
    site-wide install, go to the next step; otherwise, go to step 8.

 6. Perform a site-wide install:

	$ su root
	# make install
	# exit

 7. Go to step 9.

 8. Perform a local (user) install.  Supply the pathname of the local
    installation directory as the value of the INSTALL variable; for example,
    "$HOME/xrelib":

	$ make install INSTALL=$HOME/xrelib

 9. If you want to install the sample C test program (txre.c) into your HOME
    directory, type the following command.  Directory "xre_test" will be created:

	$ make user-install

    See the comments at the top of the make file for build instructions.  The
    sample test program allows you to enter a string and multiple RE patterns as
    arguments, then prints the results of each match to standard output.

Note that the -lxre switch or path to the XRE library (/usr/local/lib/libxre.a
or $HOME/xrelib/libxre.a) must be provided to the linker when you link your
programs.  See xre_core(3) for a description of the XRE core library routines,
and xre_format(7) for a description of the regular expression syntax.
