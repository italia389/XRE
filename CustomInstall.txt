Advanced Installation Instructions for the XRE Library and Additional Software

This distribution includes standard installer packages for the macOS platform
and Linux platforms (CentOS, Debian, GNU/Linux, Red Hat, Ubuntu, and others).
If you are installing on one of these platforms, have superuser (root)
privileges, do not want to install the XRE library in your HOME directory, and
do not want to customize the installation process, please refer to file
Install.txt for instructions on using the standard installers.

Library make files for macOS and Linux platforms are included in this
distribution.  Compilation on other Unix platforms should be possible as well,
however it has not been tested, so there may be errors.  If this occurs, please
contact the author with the details so that the problem can be resolved.  (See
the ReadMe.md file for contact information.)  Note that if you are installing on
a macOS system, Xcode must already be installed (vers. 7.2.1 or later
recommended) so that command-line tools are available.

To install the XRE library with optional customizations, perform the following
steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this CustomInstall.txt file:

	$ cd XRE-master

 2. Remove any existing package binaries:

	$ make clean

 3. Review and/or edit the #define statements in the configuration section at
    the beginning of header include/xre.h to customize the XRE library
    compilation.  Be sure to set the HaveHdr_* lines correctly.

    Note that if you intend to build the txre test program from the source files
    that are installed into your HOME directory in step 9, you must enable
    multibyte character support in include/xre.h, as follows:

		#define EnableMultibyte		1

 4. Build the XRE library.  This will create link file "libxre.a" in the current
    directory.  Note that during compilation you may see warnings about
    uninitialized variables, signed/unsigned comparisons, or other messages with
    some compilers.  These may be ignored:

	$ make

 5. Install the XRE library.  If you have superuser privileges and want to do a
    site-wide install, go to the next step; otherwise, go to step 8.

 6. Perform a site-wide install:

	$ su root
	# make install
	# exit

 7. Go to step 9.

 8. Perform a local (user) install.  Supply the pathname of the local
    installation directory with the INSTALL variable; for example,
    "$HOME/xrelib":

	$ make install INSTALL=$HOME/xrelib

 9. If you want to install the source files for the included regular expression
    test utility (txre.c) into your HOME directory, type the following command.
    Directory ~/xre_test will be created:

	$ make user-install

    See file ~/xre_test/Install.txt for build and installation instructions.

    The txre program allows you to enter a string and multiple regular
    expression patterns as arguments, then prints the results of each match to
    standard output.

Note that in order to link your programs with the XRE library, you must use the
-lxre switch or provide the library path (/usr/local/lib/libxre.a or
$HOME/xrelib/libxre.a) to the linker.  Also, see xregex(3) for a description of
the XRE core library routines, and xre_format(7) for a description of the
regular expression syntax.
