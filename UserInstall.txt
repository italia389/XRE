Instructions for Building XRE Test Software

These instructions describe how to build the txre test program.  Note that if
you are building this software on a macOS system, Xcode must already be
installed (vers. 7.2.1 or later recommended) so that command-line tools are
available.  Also note that txre.c needs to be linked with an XRE library built
with multibyte character support in order to work properly.

To proceed, perform the following steps:

 1. Move to the directory that contains this Install.txt file:

	$ cd ~/xre_test

 2. Remove any existing txre binaries:

	$ make clean

 3. If the XRE library was installed in the default location (/usr/local), go to
    step 5; otherwise, go to the next step.

 4. Edit file Makefile and change the following lines to the correct pathnames;
    that is, the installed locations of the XRE include directory and library
    file:
		InclDir = /usr/local/include
		XRELib = /usr/local/lib/libxre.a

 5. Build the test program.  This will create binary "txre" in the current
    directory:

	$ make

 6. Type the following to get usage information for txre:

	$ txre
